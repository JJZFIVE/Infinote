# Infinote

***About:*** Infinote is a web app where users record and upload audio files for the purpose of journaling with their voice instead of using a written journal.
The inspiration came from using the iPhone's Voice Memos app to record my own daily journal entries, but I wished that it had these features:
1. Speech to text transcription
1. Easy search by title or words in audio transcription
1. Access by website or phone
1. Automatic cloud backups


Infinote was my first full stack project, and I developed it during the summer of 2021. I was recovering from a sinus surgery for weeks,
and I couldn't do much, so I decided to dive into JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS, HTTP, JSON, Python, Flask, MongoDB, AWS S3, and MaterialUI.
It's clear that this project was my first take at full stack web dev – it doesn't look great and it's buggy. But I loved it, and this project took me
from 0 to 1 in the world of software engineering, where more recent projects have taken me from 1 to N (shoutout Zero To One by Peter Thiel).

*Note: I discontinued the domain name, however I've attached screenshots below.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend (JS)

### Backend (Python – I used Python because back then I didn't know JS could run on a server :) )

- MongoDB
- AWS S3 (audio file storage)
